Shoe Distribution
Write a program to track shoe brands and what stores they are in. Here are the user stories:

As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe stores.
As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.
As a user, I want store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
As a user, I do not want stores and shoes to be saved if I enter a blank name.

####Create

# To add a new brand to the list of existing brands:
   store.brands.push(new_brand)

# To create a new brand and associate them with a recipe at the same time:
   Brand.new({:store_ids => [example_store.id()]})
   test_store.save()

# to create an brand through the store:
   test_store.brands.new()

####Read

# to see which stores an brand is inside (use for filtering)
  brand.stores()

####Update

# to update ALL of a store's ingredients or ingredients' stores
  store.update({:brand_ids => [example_brand.id()]})

####Delete

# to remove an brand from a store
  store.brands.destroy(brand)
